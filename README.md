A small configurable service that can validate values against secrets without having to expose the secrets to other configurations. Home Assistant made the choice to not allow secrets inside of templates which makes checking a value against a secret in an automation or script difficult. While there are workarounds they are either insecure, rudimentary, inflexible, or some combination of these. With the Secret Service values can be validated against secrets stored in the `secrets.yaml` file or even hard coded into the service configuration.

Secrets are hashed using `bcrypt` with a random salt generated at setup time to ensure as much security as possible and limit where secrets are exposed. Secrets and hashes are not exposed via the service call or stored in the state, again the maintain as much security as possible.

## âœ¨Featuresâœ¨
 Name | Description
 -- | --
 Single Secret Validation | Validation against a single named secret.
 Grouped Secret Validation | Validation against one or more secrets with a single name. This can be useful when you want to provide different secrets but validate in a single call. Each group can only have one instance of each secret.

### Planned Features
 Name | Description
 -- | --
Rate Limiting | Configurable limits on how often secrets can be validated against to prevent brute force attacks.
Failure Limits | Configurable limits on how many times a failed validation can occur and options to handle when the limits are reached (eg. lock for a period of time)
Conditions | Allow secrets and groups to have conditions on their use allowing for even greater customization. This assumes that there's a way to use the existing condition system within the integration, more research is needed here.
